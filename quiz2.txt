"Why Model?" by Epstein was an extremely good read, and a very good tactical document that I will keep handy.  Two things struck me about this reading.  First, that Epstein did the world a service in explicitly saying that models are not only about predicting things. That task dominates the discussion about modelling, and it is good to see this push back.  Second, I loved the part when he discusses "militant ignorance" or a commitment to "I don't know," until you do.  In this world where we have certitude all over the place, all the time, it is a refreshing change to see this commitment to not knowing.

With that, you have to commit at some point.  Gross makes this point at the end of his video.

"Models in Science" is a much more formal, and somewhat dry read.  By far the most interesting part of this reading was the part on analogical models.  The mention of the spring model in physics being cross-purposed to solve so many other problems in so many other domains in class reinforced the power of this modelling type.

This leads me to a question.  Is there any other analogical model that has the broad cross domain reach that the spring model has.  I can't think of one.
