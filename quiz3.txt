So far, I like the Text.  It is extremely clear and one that is very accessible.  I plan to hold on to it, and maybe even get a hard copy.  It does have its weaknesses as it doesn't perfectly correlate with MoCs.  For example, there is nothing on Poisson that I could find in the text and mean field approximations don't show up until later in the text.  That said, I do like the text.
