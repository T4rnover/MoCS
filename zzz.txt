The cascade model is a simple toy model to help us think about energy flow in directed acyclic graph such as food webs and some power grids. Imagine n nodes with indices i = 1 to n and place an undirected edge between each unique pair with probability
p just as in the Erdos-Renyi random graph. 

Now add a direction to every edge such that each edge goes from node i to node i' < i. The index i then informs
us of the position of a node in a hierarchy (e.g. trophic level in food webs, or distance
from source in power grids) and the model can be used to help us understand the distribution of energy flow through the hierarchy.

a) Explain why this network is acyclic (i.e. contains no cycle).

b) What is the average in-degree (edges going in) of vertex i? What is the average
out-degree (edges going out) of vertex i?

c) Show that the expected number of edges that run from nodes i' > i to nodes i'=< i is (ni - i^2)*p.

d) Assuming N is even, what are the largest and smallest values of the quantity
calculated in c) and where do they occur (in i).

Note: expected edges = p * N, but with the hierarchy of our structure, we would expect the # of edges each node has to depend on its index value, i am not sure yet how to work out the math here to go from exp.edges= p * n to = (ni -i^2)*p

Write a Python Program that generated this model and answers the questions a, b, c and d.


The problem is that our compartments are bad; they are too coarse-grained. We put all
susceptible nodes in the same compartment, ignoring the fact that they do not all have the
same degree and therefore are not exposed to the same risks (or really, the same transition
rates). One approach to account for that is to create kmax compartments, where kmax is the
highest degree in the network. Infectious nodes of degree k are therefore not simply in the
I compartment, but in the Ik compartment. As we will see next week, we are now using a
configuration model to describe a dynamical process on the ensemble of all networks with
the same degree distribution, assuming nodes of equal degree follow the same rules.
We can write an equation to follow the fraction ËœIk of nodes in a given compartment

I_tilde_sub_k/dt = lambda*k*(p_sub_k - I_tilde_sub_k)*Theta - I_tilde_sub_k

where pk is the total fraction of nodes of degree k and therefore the carrying capacity for I_tilde_sub_k
which can only be between 0 and 1. The moment closure is now Theta which we interpret as the
probability that a random edge around a susceptible node leads to an infectious node.  We can calculate it like so:

Theta = SUM (k*I_tilde_sub_k)/ SUM (k*p*k)

Using the integrator of your choice, test how strong rho needs to be to eradicate an
outbreak with the following parameters: transmission rate Beta = 0.3 (week^-1
) and
recovery rate alpha = 1 (week^-1
) in a population with a geometric degree distribution
p_sub_k = p(1 - p)^k
k with p = 1/4. Assume that a random 40% of the population gets
vaccinated.
