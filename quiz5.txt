Several thoughts on this.  My first thought is that this paper presents a very unusual case of predator prey, which will usually stabilize in a limit cycle attractor, or simply stay cyclic.  This is a great paper for a relative novice in this subject as the models are simple and the products in Figure 2 specifically, are easy to interpret. 

The analog to this project was to take it and apply it to winner take all economic competitions, or, more pointedly, how you can tell when actors in a cartel or monopoly have "tipped" into an omnivorous condition.  There is a lot of work in competition economics on the subject of keeping a cartel stable, or unstable, depending on policy.  Adapting this work on Omnivory may we a useful tool.  I have not done a lit review, but it would be interesting to see if anyone has gone down this road.
